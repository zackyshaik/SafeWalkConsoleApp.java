# SafeWalk Console App 🚶‍♀️🆘

## 💡 Project Overview
**SafeWalk** is a lightweight emergency console application designed to simulate an emergency alert system. In case of danger, the user can quickly input their location or a Google Maps link, and the app generates a simulated email alert to a predefined emergency contact.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon focused on safety and personal security solutions.
